Thank you for downloading Background Bokeh VFX!

These Particle Systems rely on having a Camera with a Solid Color (it serves as a colored background). 
Make sure you do not remove the camera from the prefab.
If you can't use a camera setup that comes with the prefab, feel free to put a colored mesh as a background for the particles.
Also, there should be a light source of some kind on the scene, because the majority of particles set up to be in the additive mode.

These particles will look extra beautiful if you use a post-processing stack, for example, https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/post-processing-stack-83912
